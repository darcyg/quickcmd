Overview
--------

Curses-based utility which allows you to define a list of commands and then execute any of them when needed.

Alternatively you can 'insert' command to the terminal, which means that quickcmd will create a virtual keyboard and type the command for you. This way you can edit command before execution.

Another option is printing your command to stdout for further processing.

Features
--------

* Works in both, Linux console and in X Window terminals
* vi-like and alternative list of keyboard shortcuts
* Curses-based CUI and command line interface

Installation
---------------------

quickcmd is a python script. Simply copy it to your /usr/bin directory and
make it executable.

# chmod 755 /usr/bin/quickcmd

Please note that you need to have python and vi. quickcmd also requires
ttype (http://krason.biz/#quickcmd) to be installed.

Finally it's recommended to make a short alias to quickcmd

$ alias qq='quickcmd'

You can also add the line above to your ~/.bashrc file.
